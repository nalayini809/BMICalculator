This is a simple and responsive BMI Calculator Web Application that calculates the user’s Body Mass Index based on height and weight inputs and displays the result on a separate result page. After calculation, it greets the user by name, shows the BMI value, displays the BMI status (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obesity), and presents a visual representation along with a “Check Again” button to recalculate.
